Going forward, for any non-trivial design work we’ll do this:

Summarize topics first

I’ll list the things we need to decide as a short, numbered list.

Each item gets a Design ID like DD-001, DD-002, etc.

One decision at a time

We pick the first undecided item.

I’ll restate the question, give a clear proposal and the rationale.

We lock it in (or you adjust it), then move to the next.

Design Decision Record (DDR) format

For each decision, we conceptually store something like:

Id – e.g., DD-001

Title – short descriptive name

Status – e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Revised

Decision – what we chose

Rationale – why we chose it

We’re not implementing this in code yet, but we’ll write our notes in this style so it’s easy to export into a doc later.

I’ll follow this pattern across sessions unless you say otherwise.
